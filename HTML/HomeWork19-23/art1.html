        <h2>Research articles</h2>
        <p>
            Research articles should be fully documented reports of original research; they are always peer reviewed.
            They should be written in as concise a style as possible but should still be accessible to the broad
            readership of Development. The total length of the article should not exceed 7000 words. This word count
            does not include the reference list but does include figure legends. Additional items (figures, tables,
            movies, datasets) may be published online at the discretion of the editor and referees (a limit of 50 Mb of
            supplementary material exists per article). For more information on how to prepare a Research Article for
            submission to Development.
