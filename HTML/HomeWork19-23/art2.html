        <h2>Research reports</h2>
        <p>
            Research reports are short (maximum 3000 words), peer-reviewed, high-impact papers that can be accompanied
            by up to four display items (figures or tables). This word count does not include the reference list but
            does include figure legends. The style of a Research Report follows that of a Research Article in
            Development, the only difference being that Results and Discussion should be combined into a single Results
            and Discussion section. For more information on how to prepare a Research Report for submission to
